# Changelog

## 4.0.0-alpha01

- Added `ListaItem` for lists that can render any type of content without having to register a `ListaSectionRegistry`
- Added `attach` and `detach` to ListaPager

## 3.0.0

### New
- Moved section selection logic to `ListaSectionRegistry`. 
  - Implementations: `ClassSectionRegistry`, `ItemSectionRegistry` and `ConcatSectionRegistry`
  - Now itemViewTypes are automatically generated by default
- Allow setting a fallback section via `ConcatSectionRegistry`
- New ListaAdapter's `submitNow` and `clearNow` to submit or clear items without applying any diffing
- You can now submit nulls via `submit` or `submitNow`
- You can now customise the background executor used for applying diffing via `ListaAsyncDiffer.Config`
- `ListaAdapter.findViewHoldersOfSection` returns all ViewHolders of a given section
- New extension function for creating ViewBindings: `ViewGroup.viewHolderBinding`
- New extension functions for shared `RecycledViewPool`. Check `ActivityRecycledViewPool`

### Improvements

- Now each `ListaSection` will receive individual Adapter events instead of just the ViewHolder:
  - onViewHolderCreated
  - onViewHolderBound
  - onViewHolderRecycled
  - onViewHolderAttachedToWindow
  - onViewHolderDetachedFromWindow
  - onFailedToRecycleView
- Moved safe list dispatch logic to public class `ListaUpdateDispatcher`
- `ListaController` will now clear RecyclerView's adapter when the lifecycle owner is destroyed

### Removed
- `animateRecyclerView` was removed from `ListaController` since it's not really needed. You can override `onCurrentListChanged` to animate the RecyclerView.

## 2.0.0

- Change package name to "com.rubensousa.lista"

## 1.0.3

- Don't throw an `IllegalStateException` when `ListaController.submitList` is called without a RecyclerView attached.

## 1.0.2

#### Testing

- Loop main thread in `SmoothScrollToPositionAction` to avoid flakiness

## 1.0.1

#### `ListaController`

- Apply diffing by default in `submitList`
- Invalidate item decorations after adapter changes

## 1.0.0

- Initial release
